Other products may work as well as other supplers (YMMV)

Put your ssid and password in secrets.py
load the following on to the pico local directory using Thonny (or any other program that works):

secrets.py

main.py

pico_off.jpg

pico_on.jpg

Run main.py

The display and Thonny console should show you the local IP of the pico's web server.
Paste this address in a web broswer address bar and hit enter.

A web page should come up.
